# dart board

A web server built using [Shelf](https://pub.dev/packages/shelf).

Written in dart and you can throw requests at it, hence, dart board :)

Basic idea is to make a file serving application with features mentioned bellow:

- A folder to serve files from
- Server side generated HTML to provide interface to users
- ReST API to query status of file server(Number of files, disk space occupied by files etc)
